Set $DECTECTION to the appropriate directory 
```

```

Install the matio dependencies
```
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$DECTECTION/src/kdes/dependencies/matio:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
cd $DECTECTION/src/kdes
./install-dependencies.sh #NOTE: this will yield an error referencing doxygen. This is fine.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DECTECTION/src/kdes/dependencies/matio/src/.libs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
cd KernelDescriptors_CPU/
make
cd $CATKIN_WS
catkin_make
```

<Everything should now be built>
 
To run:

```
rosrun meldon_detection talker $CATKIN_WS
roslaunch baxter_ork detection.launch
rosrun object_recognition_ros client
```

The last step must be performed every time you wish to receive a labeling.
